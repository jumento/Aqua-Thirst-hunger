# Hytale Hunger Mod
Introduces a Hunger system to Hytale, requiring players to manage their food intake to survive and thrive in the game world.

Designed with maximum compatibility and performance in mind.

## Features
- **Hunger Bar**: A visual representation of the player's hunger level displayed on the HUD 
- **Hunger Depletion**: Hunger decreases over time, with the rate influenced by player actions such as stamina usage, or mining blocks.
- **Hunger Saturation**: Some foods will saturate your hunger bar over the 100% value, providing a buffer before hunger starts depleting again.
- **Preview Hunger Restoration**: When initiating the food consumption animation, a preview of the hunger restoration and saturation values is displayed.
- **Food Consumption**: Players can consume various food items to restore their hunger levels.
- **Status effects**: When hunger drops below a certain threshold, players experience reduced movement speed and disabled sprint.
- **Starvation Damage**: Players take damage over time when their hunger reaches zero.
- **SFX and VFX**: Includes screen effects and sound effects when starving.
- **Safe areas**: Hunger depletion is paused when players are in designated safe zones (provided by other plugins).
- **Configurable Settings**: Customize hunger depletion rates, starvation interval, starvation damage, hungry threshold, how much stamina usage and mining affects hunger, and food restoration values via a configuration file.

## Actions affecting hunger
- **Basal Metabolic Rate**: Hunger slowly depletes over time, even when the player is idle.
- **Stamina usage**: The more stamina the player uses, the faster their hunger depletes. This includes sprinting, blocking, bashing, and charging attacks.
- **Hitting blocks**: Each time the player hits a block, a small amount of hunger is depleted. Using better tools requires fewer hits to break a block, resulting in less hunger lost per block broken.

## Balance
Currently, the default configuration is pretty forgiving, if you want a more challenging experience, you may want to tweak the configuration file to increase the starvation rate and damage.

With the default configuration, you'll go from max hunger (100) to starvation (0) in about 27 minutes of real-life time. If you're running all the time, it may take around 15 minutes.

## Compatibility
This mod have been designed with compatibility in mind, ensuring it works well alongside other mods, including HUD, food and safe zone mods.
- If you use other HUD mods, make sure to use the [MultipleHUD](https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/multiplehud) mod.
  The other HUD mods that you use must support it too.
- This mod is works in both single-player worlds and multiplayer servers.
- This mod is compatible with most custom food items, as long as they use the Template_Food and don't override the default consume food interaction, which most food mod doesnt.
- Safe Areas defined by other plugins will pause hunger depletion as long as the mod that defines it uses the `Invulnerable` component, which most mods use.
- This mod modifies the `Server.Item.Interactions.Consumables.Consume_Charge_Food_T*.json` assets, so it won't be compatible with other mods that modify that asset.

## Hunger Configuration
This mod will create a configuration file under `mods/es.xcm_HytaleHungerMod/HungerConfig.json` in your world folder after the first run. You can customize the following settings:

| Key                         | Valid value                                                                                                                                         | Default Value         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The max hunger is non-configurable and is set to 100. If you want to check the default values, you can find them in the [HHMConfig](src/main/java/es/xcm/hunger/HHMConfig.java) class. 

You can use the following formula to calculate how long it takes to starve from full hunger to zero:
```
(100/(StarvationPerTick/StarvationTickRate)/60
```
The result is in minutes.

## Food Configuration
You can customize how much hunger is restored by particular food items by modifying the JSON file under `mods/es.xcm_HytaleHungerMod/FoodValuesConfig.json` in your world folder.

| Key                       | Valid value           | Default Value | Description                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `IgnoreInteractionValues` | Boolean               | false         | Whether or not to honor values at the interaction level (authored by custom food mod authors)                 |
| `IgnoreCustomAssetValues` | Boolean               | false         | Whether or not to honor values defined on the custom asset FoodValue (authored by hunger balance mod authors) |
| `TierHungerRestoration`   | Map<ItemTier, Number> | See below     | How much hunger is restored depending on the food item tier.                                                  |
| `TierMaxHungerSaturation` | Map<ItemTier, Number> | See below     | How much hunger is saturated depending on the food item tier .                                                |
| `ItemHungerRestoration`   | Map<String, Number>   | Empty         | Per item hunger restoration values.                                                                           |
| `ItemMaxHungerSaturation` | Map<String, Number>   | Empty         | Per item hunger saturation values.                                                                            |

Default values:
```json
{
  "IgnoreInteractionValues": false,
  "IgnoreCustomAssetValues": false,
  "TierHungerRestoration": {
    "Common": 15.0,
    "Uncommon": 25.0,
    "Rare": 45.0,
    "Epic": 70.0,
    "Legendary": 100.0,
    "Mythic": 140.0,
    "Unique": 190.0
  },
  "TierMaxHungerSaturation": {
    "Common": 0.0,
    "Uncommon": 15.0,
    "Rare": 30.0,
    "Epic": 45.0,
    "Legendary": 65.0,
    "Mythic": 80.0,
    "Unique": 100.0
  },
  "ItemHungerRestoration": {},
  "ItemMaxHungerSaturation": {}
}
```
Here is an example on how the `ItemHungerRestoration` and `ItemMaxHungerSaturation` value should look like. Note this are optional and the mod will always fallback to tier based values if not defined.
```json
{
  "HungerRestoration": {
    "Food_Pie_Meat": 60.0,
    "Food_Pie_Apple": 50.0
  },
  "MaxHungerSaturation": {
    "Food_Pie_Meat": 40.0,
    "Food_Pie_Apple": 35.0
  }
}
```

## Commands
This mod adds the following commands:

| Command                         | Permission                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/hunger`                       | `hungry.command.base`     | Shows a list of available commands based on user permissions.                                                                                                                                        |
| `/hunger hide`                  | `hungry.hunger.hide`      | Hides the hunger HUD for the player executing the command.                                                                                                                                           |
| `/hunger show`                  | `hungry.hunger.show`      | Shows the hunger HUD for the player executing the command.                                                                                                                                           |
| `/hunger position <position>`   | `hungry.config.position`  | Updates the hunger bar position (server-side). The updated value is saved to the config file. For a list of available positions read the configuration section or run the `/hunger position` command |
| `/hunger set <amount>`          | `hungry.hunger.set.self`  | Sets the hunger of the player executing the command to the specified amount (0-100).                                                                                                                 |
| `/hunger set <player> <amount>` | `hungry.hunger.set.other` | Sets the hunger of the specified player to the specified amount (0-100).                                                                                                                             |

When this mods runs in a single player world, the user get access to the commands `/hunger`, `/hunger hide`, `/hunger show`, `/hunger position <position>`.

## Performance
This mod is optimized for performance in high pop servers, ensuring minimal impact on TPS.
It achieves so by:
- Ensure that hunger updates are distributed evenly across multiple ticks
- Hunger ticks only apply to elegible players (Not dead, not in safe zone, not in creative, spawned in a world)
- Use events whenever possible instead of polling
- Use partial UI updates (Please note some other popular HUD mods such as EyeSpy and RPGLeveling forces full UI updates for all HUD mods)

In high pop servers its recommended that the `StarvationTickRate` is set to at least 2 seconds (default). Setting it to a lower value may result in performance issues.
