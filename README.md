# Hytale Hunger Mod
Introduces a Hunger system to Hytale, requiring players to manage their food intake to survive and thrive in the game world.

Designed with maximum compatibility and performance in mind.

## Features
- **Hunger Bar**: A visual representation of the player's hunger level displayed on the HUD 
- **Hunger Depletion**: Hunger decreases over time, with the rate influenced by player stamina usage.
- **Food Consumption**: Players can consume various food items to restore their hunger levels.
- **Status effects**: When hunger drops below a certain threshold, players experience reduced movement speed and disabled sprint.
- **Starvation Damage**: Players take damage over time when their hunger reaches zero.
- **SFX and VFX**: Includes screen effects and sound effects when starving.
- **Safe areas**: Hunger depletion is paused when players are in designated safe zones (provided by other plugins).
- **Configurable Settings**: Customize hunger depletion rates, starvation interval, starvation damage, hungry threshold, and food restoration values via a configuration file.

## Balance
Currently, the default configuration is pretty forgiving, if you want a more challenging experience, you may want to tweak the configuration file to increase the starvation rate and damage.

With the default configuration, you'll go from max hunger (100) to starvation (0) in about 27 minutes of real-life time. If you're running all the time, it may take around 15 minutes.

## Compatibility
This mod have been designed with compatibility in mind, ensuring it works well alongside other mods, including HUD, food and safe zone mods.
- If you use other HUD mods, make sure to use the [MultipleHUD](https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/multiplehud) mod.
  The other HUD mods that you use must support it too.
- This mod is works in both single-player worlds and multiplayer servers.
- This mod is compatible with most custom food items, as long as they use the Template_Food and don't override the default consume food interaction, which most food mod doesnt.
- Safe Areas defined by other plugins will pause hunger depletion as long as the mod that defines it uses the `Invulnerable` component, which most mods use.
- This mod modifies the `Server.Item.Interactions.Consumables.Consume_Charge_Food_T*.json` assets, so it won't be compatible with other mods that modify that asset.

## Configuration
This mod will create a configuration file under `mods/es.xcm_HytaleHungerMod/HungerConfig.json` after the first run. You can customize the following settings:
- `StarvationTickRate`: How often (in seconds) the hunger depletes. Also affect how often you take damage when starving.
- `StarvationPerTick`: How much hunger is lost every tick (as defined by StarvationTickRate).
- `StarvationStaminaModifier`: How much stamina affects starvation. The modifier is added to the StarvationPerTick when stamina is below its max value. Currently it interpolates the value depending in how much stamina you've used.
- `StarvationDamage`: How much damage is taken every tick (as defined by StarvationTickRate) when starving.
- `HungryThreshold`: When hunger drops below this value, the player will receive the hungry status effects (slower movement speed and disabled sprint).
- `InteractionFeedT1Amount`: How much hunger is restored when consuming a Tier 1 food item.
- `InteractionFeedT2Amount`: How much hunger is restored when consuming a Tier 2 food item.
- `InteractionFeedT3Amount`: How much hunger is restored when consuming a Tier 3 food item.
- `HudPosition`: The position where the HUD will be rendered. Defaults to AboveHotbarCentered. Can be set to BottomLeft for better compatibility with other HUD mods.

The max hunger is non-configurable and is set to 100. If you want to check the default values, you can find them in the [HHMConfig](src/main/java/es/xcm/hunger/HHMConfig.java) class. 

You can use the following formula to calculate how long it takes to starve from full hunger to zero:
```
(100/(StarvationPerTick/StarvationTickRate)/60
```
The result is in minutes.

## Commands
This mod adds the following commands:
- `/hunger set <player> <amount>`: Sets the hunger of the specified player to the specified amount (0-100). Requires the `hunger.set.other` permission.
- `/hunger set <amount>`: Sets the hunger of the player executing the command to the specified amount (0-100). Requires `hunger.set.self` permission.
- `/hunger hide`: Hides the hunger HUD for the player executing the command. No permissions required
- `/hunger show`: Shows the hunger HUD for the player executing the command. No permissions required

## Performance
This mod is optimized for performance in high pop servers, ensuring minimal impact on TPS.
It achieves so by:
- Ensure that hunger updates are distributed evenly across multiple ticks
- Hunger ticks only apply to elegible players (Not dead, not in safe zone, not in creative, spawned in a world)
- Use events whenever possible instead of polling
- Use partial UI updates (Please note some other popular HUD mods such as EyeSpy and RPGLeveling forces full UI updates for all HUD mods)

In high pop servers its recommended that the `StarvationTickRate` is set to at least 2 seconds (default). Setting it to a lower value may result in performance issues.
