# BOT (Cognitive Orchestration System)

Document Name: BOT
Status: Canonical, immutable-by-edit
Document Version: 1.0.0
Created (Local Time - America/Monterrey): 2026-01-30

## 1) Purpose

This document is the primordial base of understanding between the AI and the user.
It defines the operating rules, constraints, and protocols for Hytale mod development.

## 2) Immutability and Governance (Append-Only)

- This document must never be deleted.
- This document must always be consulted before making decisions or changes.
- This document is append-only:
  - No corrections, rewrites, or deletions are allowed.
  - Any change in rules or direction must be recorded as a new log entry.
  - Rollbacks are handled by appending a note that something is deprecated, canceled, reverted, or superseded.

## 3) Non-Contamination Rule (Hytale Only)

- The project is 100% focused on Hytale.
- Never assume the code, architecture, or APIs relate to Minecraft or any other development ecosystem.
- Do not import terminology, design patterns, or mechanics from other games unless explicitly required by Hytale docs and confirmed by sources.

## 4) Language Contract

- User-facing explanations: Spanish.
- Programming artifacts (code, identifiers, filenames): English.
- Code comments: minimal, ASCII only, no emojis.

## 5) Development Focus

- Primary domain: Hytale mod development.
- Architecture: ECS (data-oriented), not OOP.
  - Entities are ids (e.g., int).
  - Components are data-only.
  - Systems contain logic and operate over component sets.

## 6) Java Runtime Baseline

- Java JDK: 25
- This must be used until:
  - The user modifies this document, OR
  - The Java section explicitly states otherwise via a new append-only log entry.

## 7) Sources and Verification (No Invention Policy)

- Sources must be researched before stating API behavior.
- Do not invent programming behaviors, API signatures, lifecycle hooks, or server behaviors.
- The authoritative API and documentation source is:
  <https://github.com/Henry-Bonikowsky/hytale-docs>
- If something is uncertain, it must be verified in sources or asked to the user (with concrete questions).

## 8) Repository and Publishing Policy

- No changes may be published to the cloud (GitHub push, PR, releases, remote sync) unless the user explicitly permits it.
- Default stance: local-only changes and guidance.

## 9) Build / Compilation Requirement

- After finishing any change (code or configuration), the project must be compiled/build-verified.
- The exact build command depends on the project toolchain (Gradle/Maven/other).
- If the build command is not known, it must be defined as part of the next change and recorded in the log.

## 10) Loop Avoidance and Action Log Consultation

- Before proposing or executing a step, consult the action log in this document.
- Objective:
  - Avoid repeating identical actions.
  - Avoid falling into loops.
  - Keep decisions consistent with prior recorded context.

## 11) Multimedia Inputs

- If any multimedia is required (images, audio, video, diagrams), the user must provide it.
- The assistant must request it with clear specs:
  - format (png/jpg/wav/etc),
  - dimensions/resolution,
  - duration (if media),
  - and any required content constraints.

## 12) Uncertainty Handling

- If there are doubts in any aspect:
  - Request additional information from the user, including links to similar repositories or concrete references to analyze.
  - Do not guess.

## 13) System Output Standard

- Provide code in fenced blocks.
- Keep explanations short and concrete unless the user requests expansion.
- Keep ECS alignment explicit (data-only components, logic in systems).

## 14) Git Exclusions and Pre-Compilation

- Non-relevant files (build artifacts, IDE configs, logs, etc.) must always be excluded via `.gitignore`.
- The `.gitignore` file must be verified and updated before any compilation to ensure a clean and consistent repository state.

## 15) Feature Tracking (features.md)

- Each time a functionality is successfully added and confirmed by the USER, it must be recorded in `features.md`.
- `features.md` is a local-only file (should be ignored by git if not already) used to track the progress of the mod's features.
- This file provides a clear overview of the current state of the mod's capabilities.

## 16) Code Quality and Best Practices

- All programming artifacts (code, configurations, build scripts) must follow industry best practices.
- Avoid "junk code", redundant logic, or temporary hacks unless absolutely necessary and documented.
- Maintain a clean and idiomatic `build.gradle.kts`, avoiding manual resource manipulation where Gradle's built-in features suffice.
- Code must be readable, maintainable, and strictly follow the ECS pattern for Hytale.

- Actor: AI (Antigravity)
- Type: implementation
- Summary: Migrated to manual ConfigManager (Gson) to fix directory issues.
- Details:
  - Replaced Hytale's built-in `withConfig` system with a custom `ConfigManager.java`.
  - Added `com.google.code.gson:gson:2.10.1` dependency to `build.gradle.kts`.
  - Restored `Group: mx.jume.aquahunger` in `build.gradle.kts` properly.
  - The new manager writes configuration files directly to `mods/Aqua-Thirst-hunger/`, bypassing Hytale's internal data directory sandbox/prefixing behavior entirely.
  - Updated `AquaThirstHunger.java` to initialize this manager in `setup()`.
- Affected artifacts: ConfigManager.java, AquaThirstHunger.java, build.gradle.kts

- Timestamp (America/Monterrey): 2026-01-30 17:15
- Actor: AI (Antigravity)
- Type: implementation
- Summary: Configured Initial Hunger to Full (200.0) without changing internal max logic.
- Details:
  - Modified `HHMHungerConfig.java` default value for `InitialHungerLevel` to `200.0f`.
  - Left `maxHungerLevel` constant in `HungerComponent.java` at `200.0f` to prevent UI/Bar rendering issues.
